 # EPA Data Guide

 We chose California, and picked 5 different counties to compare over a period of 1999 to 2020 (ideal range). These are the county codes found in our data set:

California state code : 06
	Humboldt County: 023
	Los Angeles: 037
	San Francisco: 075
	San Diego: 073

# About parameters:
```
The parameters in AQS are identified by codes that are specific to the AQS system itself. That is, we do not use Chemical Abstract Service or any other standard naming conventions. AQS parameter codes are 5-digit numeric codes. AQS also has parameter names that are domain specific and may or may not correlate to other taxonomies.

AQS also defines parameter classifications. These are groups of parameters that have been collected for ease of extraction from the database. Examples of parameter classifications are Criteria (parameters for which National Ambient Air Quality standards have been defined), Meteorological, Core HAPs (Core Hazardous Air Pollutants), etc. A parameter may belong to any number of classifications. Classifications are not defined by regulation or policy and may change at any time.
